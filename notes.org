* Some notes on my solutions
1-25 are re-done in [[file:learning-julia.org][julia]].

** Problem 17 - Numbers as English strings
This would have been a simpler if I ignored the space and punctuation issues and wanted to just calculate the number of letters. For e.g. if ~N>100~ and ~N%100 != 0~ then *and* must be in the number. So we can ignore all the punctuation code altogether(I had to consider 8 different states to get all the corner cases).

I haven't found a good (better looking) way to get the digits of a number. I could've used recursive shifting by /10 and %10 if the number was larger.
** Problem 19 - Counting Sundays
Mostly modulo arithmetic.


** TODO  64 - Odd Period Square Roots
there is a recurrence relation, b/w a_i and x,y in (sqrt(N) - x)/y.
We start with x=0, y=0. When we finally end up with a same (x, y) the period will be determined.

** DONE 67 - Maximum Path Sum II
Same solution as problem 18.
