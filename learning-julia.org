* Learning Julia
I lost my project euler account, so I'm redoing most of my first 25 to learn julia.
I did julia in a AOC in the past, but forgot most of it.

1. [X] while loops
2. [X] while loops
3. [X] function, for loop
4. [X] I first tried, double looping from 999:100, but the first palindrome I encounterd will not the biggest one! Now how do I loop such that x*y is in descending order? Just brute forced it. ~maximum~, ~filter~ and list comprehensions
5. [X] just ~lcm(1:20)~
6. [X] just math, used a ~let~ block
7. [X] simple sqrt seive for nth prime
8. [X] math logic, finally had to use IO. ~read~, ~eof~; also optional arguments
9. [X] math, brute search for pythagorean triples
10. [X] ~module~; NumberTheory module: just a brute ~is_prime~ for now.
11. [X] ~using DelimitedFiles~ nice! used a matrix for first time too.



** DONE 12 - Higly Divisible Triangular Number
nth triangular number T_n =  n(n+1)/2. If we find the factorization for n, n+1, we can find out the number of divisors in T_n.
- first we create a large array a: a[i] = smallest_prime_factor_of(i), ~spf_vec~
- ~prime_factors~, uses this spf_vec to easily get the factorization as a ~Dict~

** DONE 13 - Large Sum
find the first 10 digits of the sum of 100 50-digit numbers.
- used matrices well
- using rows and columns by a[1, :] etc..
- ~reduce~ by dims

** DONE 14 - Longest Collatz Sequence
Which starting number under 10^6 produces longest collatz sequence.
- used partial paths; stopped building sequences which already had mapped out.
- Vector{Vector{Any}} to store paths for each starting number
Overall this was a pretty good problem, took 3.1 secs. Fast considering I kept storing all the paths.

#+begin_example
  3.291183 seconds (23.88 M allocations: 1.079 GiB, 55.43% gc time)
elapsed time (ns):  3291183435
gc time (ns):       1824176184
bytes allocated:    1158150848
pool allocs:        23880643
non-pool GC allocs: 165
malloc() calls:     3
free() calls:       3
minor collections:  13
full collections:   3
#+end_example

** DONE 15 - Lattice Paths
any sequence of n rights, n downs will give us a path. So 2n steps, we have to choose n of them as rights. The rest will be dows. So 2nCn paths
- julia has a built in ~binomial~ function

** DONE 16 - Power Digit Sum
Sum of digits of the number 2^1000. 2^10 ~ 10^3, so 2^1000 > 10^300. So atleast a 300 digit number. I just brute force calculated it, it has 302 digits. Instead of using mpc, I'm going to try using just Int64 and do it.
- ~long-int.jl~, new module ~LongNums~.
- first ~struct~ and dispatching on new types
- Base.show extended to print my new struct as an integer.

** DONE 17 - Number Letter Counts
This seems tedious.
#+begin_src julia
sum(map(n -> count(c -> Base.Unicode.isletter(c), num2words(n)), 1:1000))
#+end_src
+Not giving me the correct answer.+ small bug, corrected now.

** DONE 18 - Maximum Path Sum I
Optimal path search; problem _67_ is the same problem with bigger size to discourage brute-force. So I'll just use efficent solution here too.

** DONE 19 - Counting Sundays
How many sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century?
1 Jan 1901 ---> 31 Dec 2000
- 1901:2000
- each year can be split into 365 + isleap(year) ? 1 : 0 days
- each year can be split into months
- so we finally can have an array of month days: [31, 29, ....] ~flatmap~
- if we start counting with day1, then each month starts can be counted too: previous month start day + previous month number of days: [1, 32, 61] ~accumulate~
- sunday occurs with a period of 7, so the (day number)mod7 will always be same.
- day0 is sunday, filter all numbers with only 0mod7 ~filter~
- ~|>~ some kind of pipe operator; need to find out more about it.

** DONE 20 - Factorial Digit Sum
My ~LongNums~ will be useful again.

** DONE 21 - Amicable Numbers
- new ~Combinatorics~ module
- ~divisors~ function in ~NumberTheory~ to get all the divisors of a number

** DONE 22 - Names Scores
- ~strip~, ~sort~, using ~map~ as a zipWith takes getting used to.

** DONE 23 - Non-Abundant Sums
find the sum of all positive integers that cannot be written as a sum of two positive abundant numbers.
Abundant Number:: a number which is less than the sum of it's proper divisors.
#+begin_quote
It can be shown through mathematical analysis that any number greater than 28123 can be written as a sum of two abundant numbers, but the greatest number that cannot be expressed as such is not 28123.
#+end_quote

** DONE 24 - Lexicographic Permutations
find the millionth lexicographic permutation of 0, 1, 2, ..., 9
- the first factorial(9) of them start with 0. next factorial(9) start with 1, and so on. So since 2*factorial(9) < 1_000_000 < 3 * factorial(9), the millionth permutation starts with 2.
- Now we need (1_000_000 - 2*factorial(9))th lexicographic permutation of [0, 1, 3, ..., 9]
- at this point we can just recur.

** DONE 25 - 1000-digit fibonacci number
What is the index of first term in fibonacci sequence(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...) that has a thousand digits.
Fibonacci number has an exact formula that can be got by it's generating function 1/(1-x-x^2). the roots of the denominator polynomial are (1+sqrt(5))/2 and (1-sqrt(5))/2. If we call them g, p resp. then F(n) = (g^n - p^n)/sqrt(5).

Since (p^n)/sqrt(5) < 0.5, rounding (g^n)/sqrt(5) to the nearest integer will give the nth fibonacci number.
If we reverse this formula and take the ceiling of the number, we will get the next fibonacci number greater than a given number.
